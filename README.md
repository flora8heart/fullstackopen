# Full Stack Open

## About

The content of this course is the same as the [Full stack course](https://fullstack-hy2020.github.io/) held at the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/computer-science) at the University of Helsinki in Spring 2023.

This course serves as an introduction to modern web application development with JavaScript. The main focus is on building single page applications with ReactJS that use REST APIs built with Node.js. The course also contains a section on GraphQL, a modern alternative to REST APIs.

The course covers testing, configuration and environment management, the use of databases for storing the application's data amongst other things.

This repository contains my solutions for the course.
